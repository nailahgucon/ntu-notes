Personal NTU Module Notes Blog

**Description:** Storage Site for my code and links to my notes on GitHub using Eleventy. 

Mainly use my own CSS but used PrismJS for syntax highlighting (https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes) for my code

**Reason for Project:** Whenever I struggle with a certain module, and as any student would, I searched the internet for help. I would come across a lot of NTU CS seniors blogs or github repositories, which was good reference to know what to expect in the module. But since the syllabus got revamped during my year, there are many new aspects in majority of the modules. So hopefully, NTU CS juniors searching for help on the internet would find my blog and get the module help they need for the new syllabus.

It also a good opportunity to learn about Static Site Generators, in this case, Eleventy, and practice my web development skills.
